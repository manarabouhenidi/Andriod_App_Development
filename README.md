# Andriod_App_Development
During Junior Year at st. mary's University, San Antonio, TX, My friends and I collaborated in the Software Engineering Course (CS 3340) to develop an Andriod app that assists tutoring. This app was updated during the Senior Project course (CS 4110). This app is not developed to be sold. Also, for privacy purposes, I only selected some of the classes and their corresponding layouts that I have made to be viewed in this repository.
